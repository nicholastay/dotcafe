# .dotcafe.git

dotfiles for my Fedora 39 KDE PC. it's kept pretty light fwiw, since most of the stuff is conf'd thru KDE itself at the moment (for better or for worse. lazy now but when I have to reinstall, it won't be just restoring config files anymore...), so dots are mainly cli apps

not supported, for my own use + your reference only.
